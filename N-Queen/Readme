N-Queens Problem
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
For example:
Input: 4 
Output:
{ -, Q, -, -}
{ -, -, -, Q}
{ Q, -, -, -} 
{ -, -, Q, -}
Ps: There might be more than one solution for this input. 
so I try to Write a program to find the possible number of arrangements for any given number.
